R packages 
-Initilasation and Following Data.R
-Repository Location.R
-Language OfRepo.R
-GatherWatchersAndSize.R

All gather the apropriate data and then write it into a CXV file in order for it to be ploted in a graph.

I have used Plotly in order to plot my graphs

The 4 graphs are hard coded and presenting in R using the code in the apropriate Graph 1-4 folders.

Graph 1 - Shows the number of followers ploted against followers with a visual representation of repo size also present.
Graph 2 - Shows a histagram of all the various Code languages used in the repositories i have accessed
Graph 3 - Shows the number of repository comits per location across the world from the repositories i have accessed 
Graph 4 - Shows the size of the repo accesed ploted against the number of watchers.

These graphs can also be veiwed at https://plot.ly/~conorwallace

The excel documents used to produce these graphs have also been added.
